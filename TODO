Hardware
* figure out a solution to needing x2 RJ45 ethernet jacks on a Raspberry Pi (likely USB RJ45 dongle)
* investigate USB wifi dongle for Raspberry Pi
* investigate LCD display vs touch screen for set-up of wifi

Software
* use dhclient-exit-hooks to run myIP.py when dhcp is issue/renewed and IP is assigned or changed, saving the txt file to the BT Sync folder (so it syncs with any other computer linked to it automatically)
* work on install.py (installs required packages)
* work on config.py (updates myIP.py interface and file path)

Notes
* USB console cable works without additional drivers, need to check that multiple cables work at the same time
