Hardware
* figure out a solution to needing x2 RJ45 ethernet jacks on a Raspberry Pi (likely USB RJ45 dongle)
* check USB console cable compatability with Raspberry Pi OSs - need drivers?
* investigate USB wifi dongle for Raspberry Pi
* investigate LCD display vs touch screen for set-up of wifi

Software
* use dhclient-exit-hooks to run myIP.py when dhcp is issue/renewed and IP is assigned or changed, saving the txt file to the BT Sync folder (so it syncs with any other computer linked to it automatically)
