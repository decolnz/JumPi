Hardware
* figure out a solution to needing x2 RJ45 ethernet jacks
 - one needed for network connection, another for tftp server function
 - likely USB RJ45 dongle
* investigate USB wifi dongle for Raspberry Pi (WIP)
* investigate LCD display vs touch screen for set-up of wifi (WIP)
* microSD 128GB card for use w/ Pi B+
 - provides space for template files, firmware files, etc.
* need to figure out a "case" w/ LCD screen, cables, etc.

Software
* clean-up/refactor install.py
* work on config.py
 - should update myIP.py interface + file path
 - currently set to Pi defaults and "eth0" for ethernet only
* make myIP.py handle multiple interfaces, i.e., ethernet and usb wifi
* set-up, configure, and manage btsync purely from command line?
* set-up L2TP "always on" VPN connection or tunnel to office network
* investigate tftp options/requirements

Notes
* USB console cable works without additional drivers
 - check that multiple cables work at the same time
