Hardware
* figure out a solution to needing x2 RJ45 ethernet jacks
 - one needed for network connection, another for tftp server function?
 - likely USB RJ45 dongle
* investigate USB wifi dongle for Raspberry Pi (WIP)
* investigate LCD display vs touch screen for set-up of wifi (WIP)
* microSD 128GB card for use w/ Pi B+
 - provides space for template files, firmware files, etc.
* need to figure out a "case" w/ LCD screen, cables, etc.

Software
* if/else logic + error checking!
 - myIP.py
 - install.py
* clean-up/refactor install.py
* work on config.py
 - should update myIP.py interface + file path
 - currently set to Pi defaults and "eth0" for ethernet only
 - should check/update file chmod?
* make myIP.py handle multiple interfaces, i.e., ethernet and usb wifi
* set-up L2TP "always on" VPN connection or tunnel to office network
* investigate tftp options/requirements
* fix btsync install script/set-up
 - find a way to automatically add a specified key to sync
 - good or bad idea to have all pi's sync to same remote folder?

Notes
* USB console cable works w/ no additional drivers + multiple cables work fine
